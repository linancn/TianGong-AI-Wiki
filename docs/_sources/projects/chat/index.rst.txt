What is TianGong AI Chat?
=========================

- **Accessible Development Tool**: 
  Crafted to enable both beginners and experienced developers to easily build chatbots infused with professional knowledge.

- **RAG Implementation**: 
  Utilizes the Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) method, allowing chatbots to efficiently retrieve and apply professional data in their interactions.

  .. Note:: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) combines the power of large pre-trained language models with external databases or knowledge sources. Instead of solely relying on the internal knowledge of a model, RAG queries these databases during conversations to fetch relevant, accurate, and up-to-date information. This fusion of generative abilities and retrieval mechanisms ensures chatbot responses are both informative and contextually apt.
